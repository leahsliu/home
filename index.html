					<h3>Eat Local Campaign</h3>
					<h6>Project Co-Founder, Fall 2018 - Winter 2019</h6>
					<p>As a 15-year-old kid, pitching the idea for an anually held Eat Local Campaign was hard. Plenty of restaurant managers didn't take me seriously, but I still had
					the motivation to take a leap of faith and pitch my idea to my local Chamber of Commerce branch. And I am forever grateful to the Chamber for giving me the chance
					to work with them. ELC is an anually held event where restaurants all around the City of Surrey discount their prices for students. 
					Under my supervision, ELC increased customer traffic by 10% for 50+ restaurants.</p>

					<h3>Blueberry Board</h3>
					<h6>Project Co-Founder, Summer 2019</h6>
					<p>Through LaunchX, a competitive startup incubator program, I met the 3 people who would take Blueberry Board from idea to product. At the beginning of LaunchX, 
					we came in with the idea of a trash disposal business, but came out with a do-it-yourself mechanical keyboard kit that was meant to introduce 
					people to the hobby of building. To learn more about the startup, visit the Kickstarter page.</p>

					<h3>Ecovenient</h3>
					<h6>Project Co-Founder, Spring 2019</h6>
					<p>I created this project with a group of friends who all shared a passion for the environment. Where I lived, mom and pop shops never stayed afloat because nobody knew they existed. So I decided to work on this project in order to give these niche businesses a voice. So, we came up with the idea of connecting consumers with local organic food and eco-friendly products. ECOvenient made it easy to access the location, information, and prices of organic, sustainable shops, markets, forms, and restaurants.</p>

					<h3>Web Development</h3>
					<p>Since Covid-19 hit, I've been learning HTML and CSS. It's sort of a hobby of mine now, so please feel free to check out some of my work below.</p>
